The Chinese Zodiac (Sheng xiao) are twelve animals that represent the chinese zodiac, each year its named after one of the animals that make up the twelve year cycle. The Chinese zodiac refers to a pure calendar cycle; there are no equivalent constellations 
like those of the occidental zodiac. Each animal has a different personality and different characteristics. 

Chinese zodiac signs represent twelve different types of personalities. Traditionally beginning with the sign of the rat. Though the animal assigned for the birth year is not really who a person is, 
as there is also an animal assigned by the birth month called inner animals and by the birth hour called secret animals. These with a combination of five elements, make up 8,640 possible combinations 
for a persons personality trait, and all are considered important for the proper use of chinese astrology.

There are many versions of the story about the beginning of the zodiac, one such story begins with the rat being given the task on inciting the animals to report to the Jade Emperor to be selected for the zodiac. 
The cat being one of the animals selected was a good friend of the rat who tricked him into believing the banquet was a day later and the cat slept through it thinking it was not till the next day. When the cat found out 
he vowed to be the rats enemy for many years.
